# hello-world
The inaugural hello-world project

I am just starting out learning to code and it is basically an attempt to save my mind from the horrendousness of one Mr W.C.
One day I will get out of my awfully boring job and break into tech, which is probably what I should have been doing all these flipping years!
One day, God will bless my desire to serve Him where Jesus is least known.
